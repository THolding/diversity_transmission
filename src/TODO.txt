ParamManager::recalc_derived_parameters() should be split into separate functions and recalculate death probability functions, bite distributions, cumulative recombination p...

Implement a multi-type map...? Compare speed with naive approach.

Global parameters is a singleton - get it running like this.
Find a way to have the ParamManager know about the model, hosts, mosquitoes, MosquitoManager...


implement base adaptor, then:
	simple adaptor (change range which are not cached, e.g. recombination_scale, infection_duration_scale)
	adaptor_not_supported exception/adaptor.
	check for adaptor time collisions (overlaps).
	implement mosquito and host adaptors
	implement bite rate and recombination adaptors
	implement demographic adaptors
	implement infectivity adaptors
